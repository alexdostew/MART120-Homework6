      <h1>My Artwork</h1>

      <p>
        Everything you see below is artwork I created either for work or for fun. <br>
        I love 3D modeling and I think my favorite project was the tick you see below. Unfortunately I was never able to finish this project. <br/>
        It was made using Zbrush, Cinema4D and Substance Painter.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also posted some of my other 3D projects made for an indie game dev team, and a recent drawing I made last semester.<br>
        I am a complete newbie when it comes to drawing, but I am having a lot of fun learning.<br/>
      </p>

      <span>I hope you enjoy my art!</span><br/>
